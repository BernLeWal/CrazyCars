# CrazyCars
Convert RC-cars to autonomous driving cars using an Arduino instead of the remote control.

/src contains all applications for the CrazyCar-Arduino PCB: calibration & configuration stuff and - of course - the firmware of cars.

/test contains demo applications for checking out the function of every part of the CrazyCar plattform, like Servos, Time-of-Flight sensort, PCD and so o.

## AlphaCar 
AlphaCar is the first prototype of an autonomous driving RC-car.

## CalibrateMotors
CalibrateMotors is the software to calibrate the hardware of RC-cars to the corresponding servo-parameter values for the motor and the steering servo.
